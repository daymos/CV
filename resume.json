I'm interested in functional programming and I've been practising it in Javascript mainly, and occasionally in Haskell. After studying electrical engineering I realised that learning C as part of my uni curriculum, was the most fun part of it and I decided to become a developer. I encountered Javascript for the first time 2 and a half years ago and I built an MVP for a startup with it. In June I decided to leave the startup and come to London to learn more about web technologies, and to find challanging project to join.",
